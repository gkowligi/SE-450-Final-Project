 SE 450 Final Project

This is a mock shopping system created for SE450 final project. This project is public for now, but I will be making it private once the class is completed.

The project is implemented as a console-based Java project. There is a mock login process, and then users can view the sample product catalog/add to cart/place orders.

Some items were not fully implemented due to time constraints, but the system should mostly work as-is (assuming I didn't miss anything basic). Of course, if you try to break it you probably could, but that's not the intended use case :)

Usage: Clone/Download the project and open in Intellij/Eclipse/Java IDE, then navigate to Main.java and press the "Run" button to execute.
